					<h2>Brief</h2>
					<p>
						The client wanted to evoke a sense of connection with the produce from farm to Chef &amp; Brewer restaurants. 
						We were charged with shaping the C&B brand onto moving visuals whilst emphasising the message of fresh, seasonal menus across the narrative.

					<h2>Idea</h2>
					<p>
						We developed an idea which had a common theme of being close up with the food from the farm gate to the customers plate. Combining a shallow depth of field, HD rich imagery reminiscent of cookery shows and food adverts, to bring the Chef &amp; Brewer brand right into the visuals too.

					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>
						With 2 days in the Studio Kitchen, 2 half days in the Pub and the Farm. 3 days, total shooting time, over 4 consecutive days, this was a tricky shoot to get right. Many moving parts and a tight turnaround made it a challenge and the team had to really keep the pace up.

					<h2>Graphics</h2>
					<p>
						The constraints of timing and a still evolving new brand identity meant that we had to devise smart ways of embedding it onto objects in the film using visual effect techniques.
