					<h2>Brief</h2>
					<p>
						Global Radio was at the beginning of their rebrand and wanted to start a dialogue with their teams and potential new recruits. This brief was to create a film showing a little of the heart of each of their stations which could be updated easily each year.

					<h2>Idea</h2>
					<p>
						Our idea was to get the faces behind the stations in their natural habitat and to have the Founder talking directly to their target recruits, showing the amazing, friendly corporate culture.

					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>
						The three main challenges of this project were the number of stations to cover, their geographic spread and their talent's tight schedules. We raced around the UK over a number of days catching brief, fun moments with each team.

					<h2>Delivery</h2>
					<p>
						This project is unusual as we have to refresh portions of the film when new teams take over flagship shows, to keep it relevant. This means we have to snatch time with teams as they are embedding in their new roles.
